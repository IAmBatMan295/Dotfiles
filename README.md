This repository contains my personal configuration files for various applications. Use them as a base or reference for your own setup.

## Global Dependencies
- **JetBrainsMono Nerd Font** (or any other Nerd Font)  
  *Note: If you use a different Nerd Font, you’ll need to adjust the configs accordingly.*

## Specific Configurations

### RMPC
- You will need an image randerer for rendering album art such as imagemagic or chafa. It depends on the terminal and its config.
- The following tabs have been **removed** from the interface:
  - Artists  
  - Album Artists  
  - Album  
  - Browser  
  - Lyrics  

  I didn’t need these, so they’re excluded. If you want them back, you’ll need to configure RMPC yourself.

- Keyboard shortcuts associated with these removed tabs are currently **unassigned**. You can reassign them to any function of your choice.
